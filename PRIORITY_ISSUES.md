## Phase 2: Core Analysis (Issues 6-10)

### Issue #6: Historical Trend Calculation
**Title**: Implement basic trend analysis algorithms
**Description**: Create functions to calculate linear trends, moving averages (simple, weighted, exponential), and identify overall direction of currency movements.

### Issue #7: Volatility Analysis
**Title**: Build volatility measurement and analysis system
**Description**: Implement standard deviation calculations, Bollinger Bands, and volatility indicators to measure currency price fluctuations over time.

### Issue #8: Correlation Analysis
**Title**: Create currency correlation analysis module

### Issue #9: Seasonal Pattern Detection
**Description**: Implement seasonal decomposition algorithms to identify recurring patterns, cycles, and seasonal trends in currency data.

### Issue #10: Statistical Summary Generation
**Title**: Create comprehensive statistical reporting system
**Description**: Build functions to generate descriptive statistics, percentiles, and summary metrics for each currency over different time periods.

## Phase 3: Forecasting Models (Issues 11-15)

### Issue #11: ARIMA Model Implementation
**Title**: Implement ARIMA time series forecasting
**Description**: Create ARIMA model class with automatic parameter selection, model fitting, and prediction capabilities for currency forecasting.

### Issue #12: Prophet Integration
**Title**: Integrate Facebook Prophet for trend forecasting
**Description**: Set up Prophet library, configure holiday effects, seasonality parameters, and create forecasting pipeline with confidence intervals.

### Issue #13: LSTM Neural Network Model
**Title**: Build LSTM-based forecasting model
**Description**: Implement LSTM neural network using TensorFlow/Keras for pattern recognition and sequence prediction in currency time series data.

### Issue #14: Model Evaluation Framework
**Title**: Create comprehensive model evaluation system
**Description**: Implement cross-validation, accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE), and model comparison tools to assess forecasting performance.

### Issue #15: Ensemble Forecasting
**Title**: Build ensemble method combining multiple models
**Description**: Create system to combine predictions from ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models using weighted averaging or voting mechanisms.

## Phase 4: Visualization & Dashboard (Issues 16-20)

### Issue #16: Historical Data Visualization
**Title**: Create interactive historical price charts
**Description**: Build Plotly-based line charts showing currency prices over time with zoom, pan, and hover functionality for detailed data exploration.

### Issue #17: Forecasting Visualization
**Title**: Implement forecast visualization with confidence bands
**Description**: Create charts showing predicted values with confidence intervals, actual vs predicted comparisons, and forecast accuracy indicators.

### Issue #18: Correlation Heatmap Dashboard
**Title**: Build correlation analysis visualization
**Description**: Create interactive heatmap showing correlations between currencies with color-coded intensity and clickable details for specific currency pairs.

### Issue #19: Volatility Dashboard
**Title**: Create volatility analysis visualization
**Description**: Build charts showing volatility trends, Bollinger Bands, and volatility indicators with interactive controls for time period selection.

### Issue #20: Automated Report Generation
**Title**: Implement PDF report generation system
**Description**: Create automated system to generate comprehensive PDF reports with charts, analysis results, forecasts, and recommendations based on current data.

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies for Each Issue:
- **Issues 1-5**: Basic Python setup, pandas, numpy, sqlite3
- **Issues 6-10**: scipy, statsmodels for statistical analysis
- **Issues 11-15**: statsmodels, prophet, tensorflow, scikit-learn
- **Issues 16-20**: plotly, dash, reportlab for visualization and reporting

### Estimated Time per Issue:
- **Issues 1-5**: 2-4 hours each (setup and foundation)
- **Issues 6-10**: 3-5 hours each (core analysis)
- **Issues 11-15**: 4-6 hours each (advanced forecasting)
- **Issues 16-20**: 3-4 hours each (visualization and reporting)

### Testing Strategy:
- Each issue should include unit tests
- Integration tests for data pipeline
- Performance tests for large datasets
- User acceptance testing for dashboard features

### Success Criteria:
- All issues must use only free/open-source tools
- Code should be well-documented and maintainable
- Performance should handle 10+ years of data efficiently
- Dashboard should be intuitive and responsive
